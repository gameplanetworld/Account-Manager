# Account manager

### What do i mean with account manager?
**I mean that you can put in a account with username and password and then it will be put into a file. you can also read the file from the console if you want**

### Note:
**This is just me building a random program to improve my c++ skills. it may not be the best or good at all in that matter but i dont care to be honest. i just want to make stuff whatever i want**

### Is this a virus?
**No this is not a virus. (You can check the source code and compile if you dont belive me). windows is just saying its a virus cause its an console application.**
